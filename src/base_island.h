/// Base island class.
/**
 * This class incorporates a pagmo::population and a pagmo::algorithm::base used to evolve the population. Each time the evolve() (or evolve_t()) method is called,
 * a derived island class will execute the algorithm's evolve method on the population. The actual mechanism of launching the evolve method is defined in the
 * derived class - see \ref evolution_details "below" for more details. While evolution is undergoing, the island is locked down and no further operations will be allowed. The method join() can be used to wait until
 * evolution on the island has terminated. The busy() methods can be used to query the state of the island.
 *
 * The island can either exist as a stand-alone object or as a component of an archipelago.
 * If the island belongs to an archipelago, it can exchange individuals with other islands in the archipelago. The topology of the archipelago determines
 * the connections between islands, whereas every island can define migration policies to specify how to select and replace individuals during migration.
 * The relevant policy classes are migration::base_s_policy (selection policy) and migration::base_r_policy (replacement policy).
 * The probability of inserting migrating individuals into the island is regulated by the migration probability parameter. These migration parameters can be specified
 * upon island construction and they are given (hopefully) reasonable default values. See the constructors for detailed information.
 *
 * The interface of this class mirrors the interface of the population class. It is hence possible to get and set individuals, get the population size,
 * access the population champion, etc. The main difference
 * is that the methods of this class will never return references to internal members, in order to protect the internal state of the island while evolution is undergoing.
 * All getters methods will thus return copies instead of references, and all public methods will wait for an ongoing evolution to terminate before performing any action.
 *
 * \section evolution_details Implementation of the evolution methods
 *
 * When one of the evolution methods (evolve() or evolve_t()) is launched, the following sequence of events takes place:
 * - if the is_thread_safe() method returns true and the island either is stand-alone or belongs to an archipelago for which archipelago::is_thread_safe() also returns true:
 *   - a local thread is opened and the perform_evolution() method is called from the new thread using as arguments the population and the algorithm stored in the island;
 *   - if the is_blocking() method returns true and the island is stand-alone:
 *     - execution will block until the evolution has concluded;
 *   - else:
 *     - the evolution method will return while the actual evolution is running in the separate thread;
 * - else:
 *   - the perform_evolution() method is called from the main thread.
