 *
 * The Watts-Strogatz model is a ring lattice network in which forward edges are rewired with random probability. Such a network
 * has small-world properties, including short average path lengths and high clustering.
 *
 * In this implementation the graph grows dynamically by rewiring all the connections each time an island is added. Note that up to the the first K + 1
 * insertions, the topology will be fully connected. Afterwards, the topology will be a proper Watts-Strogatz model.
 *
 * Since the addition of a single element to the topology implies the rewiring of the whole topology, for archipelago objects of large size it is advisable
 * to build the topology outside the archipelago specifying the number of islands it will contain, and use archipelago::set_topology() to apply it to an existing
 * (and possibly unconnected) archipelago.
