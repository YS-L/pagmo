/**
 * It's a kind of magic... an incremental algorithm for constructing a hypercube by Marek.
 *
 * The algorithm takes advantage of the observation that a hypercube has a recursive structure:
 * a hypercube of dimension n (for n > 0) is composed of two connected in paralell hypercubes
 * of dimension (n-1). In consequence, every node in an n-dimensional hypercube belongs either to the
 * "first" or to the "second" sub-hypercube of dimension (n-1).
 * Also, for every node in an n-dimensional hypercube one can identify a series of
 * hypercubes of decreasing dimensions, n-1, n-2, ... 1 to which the node belongs. Each
 * node belongs to exactly one hypercube for each of these dimensions.
 * So when adding a new node to a partial hypercube of dimension n, for each dimension n, n-1, ... 1 one has to:
 * <ul><li>Determine to which "sub-hypercube" of dimension (n-1) the node belongs</li>
 * <li>If the node belongs to the "second" hypercube, one has to add a connection to a coresponding node in the "first" hypercube</li>
 * </ul>
