 *
 * Laplace is a Jupiter mission proposed as a candidate mission for the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025
 * and has been one of the mission concepts selected by the SSAC in October 2007 for an Assessment
 * study. The SSAC had decided that an Outer Planet mission should be one of the L-class
 * mission candidates for the first slice of the Cosmic Vision plan, and recommended that
 * both Laplace and Tandem concepts should be studied initially, with a decision on which
 * one to pursue to take place following a better definition of the mission's characteristics.
 *
 * In early February 2009 ESA and NASA jointly announced that the Europa-Jupiter
 * System Mission, or Laplace, would be the candidate for the first L mission,
 * with a possible launch date in 2020.
 *
 * We transcribe here Laplace interplanetary trajectory transfer problem as an MGA-DSM
 * problem leaving to the user the possibility to specify the fly-by sequence.
 * This creates a problem of dimension \f$6 + 4(n-1)\f$, where \f$n\f$ is the number of
 * trajectory legs. Objective function is the total DV with a 200m/s penalty per month past the 8yr
 * of flight time.
