/// Base DTLZ Multi-objective optimization problem.
/**
 * The DTLZ test suite was introduced by Deb et. al in order to create benchmark problems
 * with various features that are scalable to any number of objectives and dimensions. The first
 * seven DTLZ problems are constructed with a bottom up approach: First, the pareto-optimal front is described by a surface. 
 * Then, parallel layers of this surface are used to build the remainder of a decision space. 
 * For this, a distance function g is introduced which is minimized for pareto-optimal solutions. 
 * By evaluation of the g-function we thus get information how close the a solution is to the Pareto-optimal front. 
 * This is used to define a simple convergence metric (p-distance) that is average value of the g-function over all individuals.
 * 
 * The first seven DTLZ problems are already implemented in PaGMO but you can create your own DTLZ-style problems
 * by subclassing this base class. In order to do this, you have to implement a g-function. 
 * The shape of the front itself has to be defined in the implementation
 * of the objective function. The p-distance and a generic 3d-plot will then automatically be 
 * available for your new problem.
