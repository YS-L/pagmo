 *
 * TandEM primary goals are to understand the atmosphere, surface and interior,
 * to determine the chemistry, and to derive constraints on the origin and evolution of
 * Titan and of the saturnian system as a whole, with an emphasis on Enceladus.
 *
 * TandEM had been proposed as an L-class candidate mission for the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025
 * programme in response to the Call for Proposals issued by ESA in March 2007,
 * and has been one of the mission concepts selected by the SSAC in October 2007
 * for an Assessment study. The SSAC had decided that an Outer Planet mission should be one
 * of the L-class mission candidates for the first slice of the Cosmic Vision plan,
 * and recommended that both TandEM and Laplace (a mission to the Jupiter system)
 * concepts should be studied initially, with a decision on which one to pursue to take place
 * following a better definition of the mission's characteristics.

 * In early February 2009 ESA and NASA jointly announced that the Europa-Jupiter System Mission,
 * or Laplace (see problem::laplace), would be the candidate for the first L mission.
 *
 * We transcribe here TandEM interplanetary trajectory transfer problem as an MGA-DSM
 * problem and we allow to instanciate 25 different types, depending on the fly-by sequence adopted.
 * The mission data are taken from those used by a joint ESA/NASA working group that performed, together with industrial partners
 * a preliminary trajectory design for the TandEM mission during the first months of 2008.
 * Please refer to http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/inf/op/globopt/TandEM.htm to select the proper instance. A default
 * choice is 6, which corrsponds to an EVEES fly-by sequence. The possibility of adding one additional constraint
 * on the time-of-flight is given. If such a constraint is specified the components x[4]-x[7] are no longer time of flights
 * but they represent the percentage of the remaining time of flight to be used in one leg. Thus the linear constraint
 * on the time of flight is automatically transformed into a box constraint.
 *
 * The problem is transcribed as an MGA-DSM problem allowing one chemical manouvre per trajectory leg.
 * The objective function is defined as \f$ f = -\log(m_f)\f$ where \f$m_f\f$ is the final spacecraft mass.
 * The problem is also part of the Global Trajectory Optimization database (GTOP)
 *
 * tandem is a box constrained single objective, continuous optimization problem of dimension 18.
