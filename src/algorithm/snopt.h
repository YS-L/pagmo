/// Wrapper for the SNOPT solver
/**
 * SNOPT is a quite popular commercial solver coded in FORTRAN77 by GILL and MURRAY.
 * Its popularity stems from its being able to solve efficiently many different problems
 * thanks to what many would call 'black-magic' heuristic implemented in the solver that is
 * otherwise an SQP solver. We provide in PaGMO the wrappers around the libraries that
 * the user needs to have installed and licenced for in his computer.
 *
 * In order to interface to SNOPT succesfully, PaGMO needs to find in the system the libraries:
 * snopt, snprint, blas, f2c, m and gfortran (in case the snopt libraries were compiled using gfortran)
 *
 * CAREFUL:
 *	1 - SNOPT works only for minimization.
 *	2 - The final solution is guaranteed to be within the box constraints by forcing it after the snopt call
 *
 * From the SNOPT User-Manual:
 *
 * SNOPT is a general-purpose system for constrained optimization. It minimizes a
 * linear or nonlinear function subject to bounds on the variables and sparse linear or
 * nonlinear constraints. It is suitable for large-scale linear and quadratic programming
 * and for linearly constrained optimization, as well as for general nonlinear programs.
 * SNOPT finds solutions that are locally optimal, and ideally any nonlinear functions
 * should be smooth and users should provide gradients. It is often more widely useful.
 * For example, local optima are often global solutions, and discontinuities in the function
 * gradients can often be tolerated if they are not too close to an optimum. Unknown
 * gradients are estimated by finite differences.
