/// The Compass Search Solver (CS)
/**
 * In the review paper by Kolda, Lewis, Torczon: 'Optimization by Direct Search: New Perspectives on Some Classical and Modern Methods'
 * published in the SIAM Journal Vol. 45, No. 3, pp. 385-482 (2003) we read the following description of the compass search
 * algorithm:
 * 
 * 'Davidon describes what is one of the earliest examples of a direct
 * search method used on a digital computer to solve an optimization problem:
 * Enrico Fermi and Nicholas Metropolis used one of the first digital computers,
 * the Los Alamos Maniac, to determine which values of certain theoretical
 * parameters (phase shifts) best fit experimental data (scattering cross
 * sections). They varied one theoretical parameter at a time by steps
 * of the same magnitude, and when no such increase or decrease in any one
 * parameter further improved the fit to the experimental data, they halved
 * the step size and repeated the process until the steps were deemed sufficiently
 * small. Their simple procedure was slow but sure, and several of us
 * used it on the Avidac computer at the Argonne National Laboratory for
 * adjusting six theoretical parameters to fit the pion-proton scattering data
 * we had gathered using the University of Chicago synchrocyclotron.
 * While this basic algorithm undoubtedly predates Fermi and Metropolis, it has remained
 * a standard in the scientific computing community for exactly the reason observed
 * by Davidon: it is slow but sure'.
