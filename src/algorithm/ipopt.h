/// Wrapper for the IPOPT solver
/**
 * IPOPT is an Interior Point Optimization solver released under the CPL licence. Our wrapper is
 * generic and does not use the hessian information letting IPOPT deal with it. Gradients and Jacobian are
 * evaluated by central differences with a stepsize of 10-8 stepsize. We offer control
 * over only a few IPOPT options, take care in particular of the dual_inf_tol as the hessian_approximation,
 * limited_memory option (i.e. hessian is not provided by the user) makes the dual_inf to remain quite high.
 *
 * CAREFUL:
 *	1 - IPOPT works only for minimization.
 *	2 - The final solution is guaranteed to be within the box constraints by forcing it after the ipopt call
 *
 * IPOPT has severa lib dependencies that overlaps with SNOPT lib dependencies. Take care that you link
 * to the correct ones, especially for the blas lib that can give problem if coming from SNOPT native source code
