/// Wrapper for NLopt's Sbplx algorithm.
/**
 * From NLopt's documentation:
 *
 * <EM>This is my re-implementation of Tom Rowan's "Subplex" algorithm. As Rowan expressed a preference that other implementations of
 * his algorithm use a different name, I called my implementation "Sbplx" [...].
 * Subplex (a variant of Nelder-Mead that uses Nelder-Mead on a sequence of subspaces) is claimed to be much more efficient and robust
 * than the original Nelder-Mead, while retaining the latter's facility with discontinuous objectives, and in my experience these claims
 * seem to be true in many cases.</EM>
 *
 * This algorithm is a derivative-free single-objective continuous minimiser that supports box constraints.
 *
 * @see T. Rowan, "Functional Stability Analysis of Numerical Algorithms", Ph.D. thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, 1990.
